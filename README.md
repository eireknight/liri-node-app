LIRI Bot

Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This app can take in one of the following commands:

concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

What Each Command Should Do
node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>

Name of the venue
Venue location
Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

Artist(s)
The song's name
A preview link of the song from Spotify
The album that the song is from
If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'

Title of the movie.
Year the movie came out.
IMDB Rating of the movie.
Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
Country where the movie was produced.
Language of the movie.
Plot of the movie.
Actors in the movie.
If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

node liri.js do-what-it-says

Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.

Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.

You will need your own .env files and API keys to make this work for yourself.
